# Stock Analysis Using VBA
Performing analysis on energy stock data over multiple years while refactoring initial code to increase efficiencies.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to utilize VBA to automate the task of analyzing a number of energy stocks performance over 2 years to help determine if they were worth the investment.  Further steps were taken to identify ways to refactor, or improve the code by making small changes without changing the output.  The file, [VBA_Challenge.xlsm](https://github.com/dschul01/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm),contains the original and refactored code as well as UI buttons to calculate each year's analysis.  The output will also provide the time to run through the macro for the user to see how well the refactored code improves efficiencies.
